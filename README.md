**Customer Segmentation Capstone Project**

**Project Overview:**
Conducted an in-depth analysis to identify major customer segments for a UK-based online retail company specializing in unique all-occasion gifts. This project aimed to uncover insights that could help the company better understand its customer base and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Performed extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand sales trends and customer behaviors.
- Developed an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary value) model to categorize customers based on their purchase history.
- Applied clustering algorithms (K-means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering) to segment customers into meaningful groups.

**Key Findings:**
- Identified top-selling products and the best-performing months and days for sales.
- Determined that most customers come from the UK, Germany, and France.
- Found that November, October, and December are peak months for purchases.
- Discovered two optimal customer segments through clustering analysis.

**Conclusion & Recommendations:**
- Focus marketing efforts on peak sales months and top customer segments.
- Enhance targeted promotions for top-selling products.
- Use insights from customer segments to improve customer retention strategies.

**Technologies Used:**
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
